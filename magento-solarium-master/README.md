Solr search extension for Magento
================
**We are sorry but we cannot offer customer support for this extension, and it is provided "as-is" for free.**

The default MySQL Fulltext search is not performing very well on more serious shops. It is slow and the results aren't very relevant. Apache's Solr does a much better job in delivering fast and relevant results. We have used the Solarium PHP library to build Solr into Magento CE.
